# Day 2

## Overview

Today, we will do more with `matplotlib`.


* bar graphs
* line graphs
* box plots (will be useful tomorrow)
* scatter plots
* [choropleth plots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map) (map plots)

Also we will learn to

* create figures with multiple sub-figures (called subplots)
* customize labels, colors, error bars etc.

In the exercises, we will use this to further visualize and analyze the campaign donations data.

`matplotlib` is quite powerful, and is intended to emulate matlab's visualization facilities.   We will give you a basic understanding of how plotting works, which should be enough for a majority of the charts that you will want to create.

## Introduction

When should you use visualizations

Purpose of visualizations.

### Figure and Subplots

The package we will be using is `matplotlib.pyplot`.  It provides a lot of shorthands and defaults (we used some of them yesterday when making line charts), but today we will do things the "right way".  

A `figure` is the area that we will draw in.  We can specify that it is 50 inches wide and 30 inches tall.

	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	fig = plt.figure(figsize=(50, 30))
	subplot1 = fig.add_subplot(2, 3, 1)
	subplot2 = fig.add_subplot(2, 3, 2)


It is common to create multiple subfigures or `subplots` in a single figure.  `fig.add_subplot(nrows, ncols, i)` tells the figure to treat the area as a nrows x ncols grid, and return an [Axes](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/axes_api.html) object that represents the i'th grid cell.  You will then create your chart by calling methods on object.  It helps me to think of an Axes object as a subplot.

For example, the above code creates a figure with the following layout.  The black box is the area of the figure, while each blue box is a subplot in a 2x3 grid.  The number in a blue box is the subplot's index.  

<center><img src="./subplotlayout.png" width="50%"/></center>

It's important to mention that `add_subplot` does not actually create a grid, it just finds the area in an imaginary grid where a `subplot` should be and return an object that represents the area.  Thus it is possible to do draw on overlapping `subplots`.

	fig.add_subplot(2, 3, 1)
	fig.add_subplot(2, 1, 1)

You will often see a shorthand for creating subplots when the number of rows and number of columns are less than 10.  `fig.add_subplot(xyz)` returns the z'th subplot in a x by y grid.  So `fig.add_subplot(231)` returns the first subplot in a 2x3 grid.  

### How Drawing Works

While `matplotlib` provides a lot of convenience functions for plotting and scaling different types of charts, at its core, it still draws points, lines, and polygons at x,y coordinates.  For example, it doesn't know how multi-column bar charts work and requires manual input.  As you use `matplotlib`, keep in mind that:

* Many of the plotting functions will ask you to specify things similar to x and y coordinates or offsets.
* When you call a drawing function, it won't rearrange the layout of what was drawn before.  It simply draws the pixels **on top of** what has been drawn before.

## Let's Plot Some Graphs!

Let's get to drawing graphs!  By the end of this tutorial, you will have experience creating bar charts, line charts, box plots, scatter plots, and choropleths (map plots).   We will walk you through how to create a figure similar to

<img src="./final_graph.png" width="750"/>

This figure creates subplots in a 3x2 grid, so let's first setup the figure and generate two sets of data.  Both sets have the same x values, but different y values.

	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	import random
	random.seed(0)

	fig = plt.figure(figsize=(50, 30))
	
	N = 100
	xs = range(N)
	y1 = [random.randint(0, 50) for i in xs]
	y2 = range(N)



### Bar Plots [documentation](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/axes_api.html#matplotlib.axes.Axes.bar)


`subplot.bar(left, height, width=0.8, bottom=None, **kwargs)`

The bar plot function either takes a single left and height value, which will be used to draw a rectangle whose left edge is at `left`, and is `height` tall:

	subplot.bar(10, 30)

or you can pass a list of lefts values and a list of height values, and it will draw bars for each pair of left,height value.  For example, the following will create three bars at the x coordinates 10, 20 and 30.  The bars will be 5, 8, 2 units tall.

	subplot.bar([10, 20, 30], [5, 8, 2])

`matplotlib` will automatically scale the x and y axes so that the figure looks good.  While the numbers along the x and y axes depend on the values of `lefts` and `heights`, the sizes of the bars just depend on their relative values.

The `width` keyword argument sets width of the bars  It can be a single value, which sets the width of all of the bars, or a list that specifies the list of each bar.  Set it relative to the differences of the `left` values.  If the `left` values are spaced one unit apart and I am drawing 2 sets of bars, then I usually set the width to `1 unit / (2 + 1)`.

The `bottom` keyword argument specifies the bottom edge of the bars. 

	subplot.bar([10, 20, 30], [5, 8, 2], width=[5,5,5], bottom=[5, 10, 15])

<img src="./bar1.png" width=300/>

The following code reproduces the bar graph.  Since we want the bars to be evenly spaced apart, we set `left` to the `numpy` equivalent of `range(len(xs))`.  Numpy arrays let us perform math operations on every element in the array.  So `left+width` adds `width` to every element in `left`, which serves to shift the second set of bars to the right by `width` units.

	import numpy as np
	left = np.arange(len(xs))
	width = 0.25

	subplot = fig.add_subplot(3,2,1)
	subplot.bar(left, ys, width=width)
	subplot.bar(left+width, ys2, width=width, bottom=ys)

You can further customize your bar charts using the following popular keyword arguments:

* `color='blue'`: set color to a hex value ("#ffffff"), a common color name ("green"), or a shade of grey ("0.8").
* `linewidth=1`: the width of the bar's border.  set it to `0` to remove the border.
*  `edgecolor='blue'`: set the color of the bar's border.
* `label='a name'`: give a set of bars a name.  Later, we will teach you how to create legends that will display the labels.

### Line Plots [documentation](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/axes_api.html#matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot)

`subplot.plot(xs, ys, **kwargs)`

The `plot` command draws a line graph.  It takes a list of x values and y values, and draws a line between every adjacent pair of points.

`subplot.plot(xs1, ys1, xs2, ys2, …)` is a convenient shorthand for:

    subplot.plot(xs1, ys1)
    subplot.plot(xs2, ys2)
    … 

To reproduce the line graph, we can simply write

    subplot = fig.add_subplot(322)
    subplot.plot(xs, ys1, xs, ys2)

You can also customize the lines using the keyword arguments:

* `color='green'`: same as `color` for bar graphs
* `marker=None`: specify the marker to draw at each point.  I commonly use `'*', '+', '.'` or `'o'`.  Set it to `None` to not draw markers.  The documentation has a full list of the available markers.
*  `label='a name'`: give a line a name.  I usually call `plot()` for each line if I want to give each one a name.

### Box Plots [documentation](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/axes_api.html#matplotlib.axes.Axes.boxplot)

`boxplot(data)`

Boxplots are used to summarize and compare groups of numerical data.  Each box summarizes a set of numbers and depicts 5 parameters:

* The smallest number
* The lower quartile
* The median
* The upper quartile
* The largest observation

`subplot.boxplot` will automatically compute these values, and also ignore numbers that it thinks are outliers.  Don't worry about when and why they are used -- we will discuss that tomorrow.  Just know that **one box summarizes a set of numbers**.

Unlike the other charts, you can't draw each box individually.  The `data` variable is either a list of numbers, in which case it will compute and draw a single box:

    subplot.boxplot(range(10))

or `data` can be a list of lists.  In which case, it will compute and draw a box for each list.  The following code reproduces the box plot shown earlier.  We create sets of data (`boxdata1`, `boxdata2`, `boxdata3`) and create a box for each set.  

    subplot = fig.add_subplot(323)
    boxdata1 = [random.randint(0, 20) for i in xrange(10)]
    boxdata2 = [random.randint(20,40) for i in xrange(10)]
    boxdata3 = [random.randint(40,60) for i in xrange(10)]
    data = [boxdata1, boxdata2, boxdata3]
    subplot.boxplot(data)

You can customize your box plots with the following keyword arguments

* `vert=1`:  By default, the boxes are drawn vertically.  You can draw them horizontally by setting `vert=0`
* `widths=None`:  Like `width` in bar charts, this sets the width of each box

### Scatter Plots [documentation](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/axes_api.html#matplotlib.axes.Axes.scatter)

`subplot.scatter(x, y, s=20, c='blue', marker='o', alpha=None)`

This method will draw a single point if you give it a single x,y pair

    subplot.scatter(10, 10)

or you can give it a list of x and a list of y values

    subplot.scatter([0, 1, 2], [9, 3, 10])

I've included the commonly used keyword arguments

* `s=20`: sets the size of each point to 20 pixels.  
* `c='blue'`: sets the color of each point to blue
* `marker='o'`: each point will be drawn as a circle.  The [documentation](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/axes_api.html#matplotlib.axes.Axes.scatter) lists  large number of other markers
* `alpha=None`: the alpha (transparency) value of the points.  Between `0` and `1`.

### Choropleths/Maps

Cartography is a very involved process and there is an enormous [number of ways](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/basemap/doc/html/users/mapsetup.html) to draw the 3D world in 2D. Unfortunately, we couldn't find any native `matplotlib` facilities to easily draw US states and counties.  It's a bit of a pain to get it working, so we've written some wrappers that you can call to draw colored state and counties in a `subplot`.  We'll describe the api, and briefly explain how we went about the process at the end.

The API is defined in `resources/util/map_util.py`.  You can import the methods using the following code:

    import sys
    # this adds the resources/util/ folder into your python path
    # you may need to edit this so that the path is correct
    sys.path.append('resources/util/')
    from map_util import *

* `draw_county(subplot, fips, color='blue')`: draws the county with the specified `fips` [county code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_county_code).  Most datasets that contain per-county data will include the fips code.  If you don't include a `color`, we will pick a nice shade of blue for you.
* `draw_state(subplot, state_name, color='blue')`: draws the state with the full state name as specified by the [official USPS state names](https://www.usps.com/send/official-abbreviations.htm).  If you don't include `color`, we will pick a shade of blue for you.
* `get_statename(abbr)`: retrieve the full state name from its abbreviation.  The method is case insensitive, so `get_statename('CA')` is the same as `get_statename('ca')`.

We also included a list of all fips county codes and state names in `datasets/geo/id-counties.json` and `datasets/geo/id-states.json`.  We will use them to reproduce the map charts.  

    
    import json

    # Map of Counties
    #
    subplot = fig.add_subplot(325)
    data = json.load(file('../datasets/geo/id-counties.json'))
    for fips in data:
        draw_county(subplot, fips)

    
    # Map of States
    #
    subplot = fig.add_subplot(326)
    data = json.load(file('../datasets/geo/id-states.json'))
    for state in data:
        draw_state(subplot, state)

The files are in JSON format, so we call `json.load(file)`, which parses the files into python lists.  The rest of the code simply iterates through the fips' and states, and draws them.


#### The gritty details

The process of drawing maps yourself requires a number of steps:

1. Download shape files.  A shape file specifies the lat, lon positions that describe the border of an area (e.g., county, zip code, state).  
1. Parse the shape files.  They come in all types of formats.  We downloaded the shape files that [D3](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/) uses.  It comes in the [GeoJS](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html) format, which is nice because `json` can parse it for us.
    * Remember how we mentioned that there lots of ways to draw the world in 2D.  Our shape files use the [Albers Equal Area Projection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albers_projection), which is also used by the US Census Bureau.
1. Once we have the shapes, we need to draw polygons in the subplot.  Thankfully `subplot.fill(xs, ys)` fills in the region defined by the list of x,y points.
1. Our methods actually take any keyword argument that `subplot.fill()` accepts.  So take a look at its [documentation](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/axes_api.html#matplotlib.axes.Axes.fill) if you want to further customize your maps.


## Customizing Subplots

We only touched a small part of what `matplotlib` can do.  Here are some additional ways that you can customize subplots.

### Keyword Arguments

* `xerr=[]`: list of floats that specify x-axis error bars.
* `yerr=[]`: list of floats that specify y-axis error bars

### Additional Charting Methods
* `subplot.loglog(xs, ys)`: plots a log-log line graph
* `subplot.semilogx(xs, ys)`: plots the x-axis in log scale
* `subplot.semilogy(xs, ys)`: plots the y-axis in log scale
* `subplot.fill(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,…)`: draws a filled polygon with vertices at `(x1,y1), (x2,y2), …`.  
* `subplot.text(x,y,text)`: write `text` at coordinates `x,y`.

### Subplot Customization

- `subplot.clear()`: clear everything that has been drawn on the subplot.
- `subplot.legend(loc='upper center', ncol=2)` - add a legend.  You can specify where to place it using `loc`, and the number of columns in the legend.
- `subplot.set_title(text)`: Set the subplot title.
- `subplot.set_xlabel(text)`: Set the x-axis label
- `subplot.set_xticks(xs)`: Draws x-axis tick marks at the points specified by `xs`.  Otherwise `matplotlib` will draw reasonable tick marks.
- `subplot.set_xticklabels(texts)`: Draw x-axis tick labels using the `texts` list.
- `subplot.set_xscale(scale)`: Sets the x-axis scaling.  `scale` is `'linear'` or `'log'`.
- `subplot.set_ylabel()`
- `subplot.set_yticks()`
- `subplot.set_yticklabels()`
- `subplot.set_yscale()`
