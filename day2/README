# Day 2

## Overview

Today, we will do more with `matplotlib`.


* bar graphs
* line graphs
* box plots (will be useful tomorrow)
* scatter plots
* choropleth plots (map plots)

Also we will learn to

* create figures with multiple sub-figures (called subplots)
* customize labels, colors, error bars etc.

We will use this to further analyze.

`matplotlib` is quite powerful, and is intended to emulate matlab's visualization facilities.   We will teach you the basics, which should be enough for most people.
